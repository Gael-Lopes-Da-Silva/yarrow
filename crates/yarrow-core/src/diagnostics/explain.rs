        title: "unwrap and fallible returns",
        body: "\
A function declared `with |T Err|` is fallible: success carries `T` (or nothing \
if `T` is void), and failure carries an error member in an envelope.

`unwrap` applies to that envelope. On success it pushes the payload. On failure \
it propagates the error to the caller, so the caller must also be fallible \
(`with |T Err|`). Using `unwrap` in a function that cannot error is rejected.

On a value that is not an error envelope, `unwrap` is an identity (a no-op).

If the caller cannot propagate, recover with `handle ... fallback ... end` \
instead of `unwrap`. Anonymous `|T U|` unions are only supported as this \
fallible-return form, not as general types.",

Raw pointers, `mem.allocate` / `free` / `load` / `store`, and calls to \
`unsafe function` need an unsafe context. Wrap the operation in \
`unsafe ... end`, or mark the enclosing function `unsafe function`.

`unsafe` does not turn off type, stack, ownership, or borrow checking.",

Native executable emit links the program object with the runtime archive for \
the selected target using a system linker (`ld` / `lld`). Yarrow does not drive \
`cc` / `gcc` / `clang` to compile CRT or user code.

Install binutils `ld` or LLVM `lld`, and ensure libc CRT objects for the target \
are visible (on NixOS, a stdenv with glibc). Path discovery may use \
`cc -print-file-name` when present; that is lookup only. For a non-host triple, \
set `YARROW_AOT_SYSROOT` or `YARROW_AOT_CRT_DIR`, or install a matching cross \
toolchain (see docs/RUNTIME.md).",

A function parameter is marked `copy`, but the parameter type is not heap-backed \
