# Style guide

How Yarrow source (`.yar`) should look. Language rules live in [`GRAMMAR.md`](GRAMMAR.md) and [`SYNTAX.md`](SYNTAX.md); this document is about layout, naming, and idiomatic form.

The goal is one readable default style so programs look familiar and diffs stay small. Tools and formatters should target this guide.

---

## Principles

1. **Postfix clarity** - Write stack phrases so left-to-right reading matches evaluation order: operands, then the word that consumes them.
2. **One idea per line** - Prefer a single stack effect or statement per line unless a short phrase clearly belongs together.
3. **Visible structure** - Nesting is always `… do/if/match/for/defer/unsafe/case … end`. Keep `end` aligned with the opener’s indent.
4. **Safe by default** - Mark `public` and `unsafe` only where needed. Do not sprinkle redundant keywords.
5. **Match the grammar tour** - When unsure, follow the shape in [`GRAMMAR.md`](GRAMMAR.md) and [`examples`](examples/README.md).

| Rule                | Convention                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Encoding            | UTF-8                                        |
| Line endings        | LF (`\n`)                                    |
| Trailing whitespace | None on any line                             |
| Final newline       | Required                                     |
| File extension      | `.yar`                                       |
| Module path         | Dots map to directories: `"a.b"` → `a/b.yar` |

One public module per file. Nested helpers may live in the same file or in a sibling path under a package directory.

---

## Indentation and line width

- Indent with **one tab per nesting level** (same as [`GRAMMAR.md`](GRAMMAR.md) and the examples).
- Do not mix tabs and spaces for indent.
- Soft wrap target: **100 columns**. Break long stack phrases before a consuming word (`call`, `set`, an operator, `if`, …) rather than mid-literal when possible.
- Continuation lines indent one level deeper than the start of the phrase.

```yarrow
# Prefer
self.scores score list.push_last call unwrap

# Long call: break before the callee / `call`
very_long_argument_name
other_arg
module.very_long_function_name call
```

---

## Blank lines

- Separate **top-level items** (requires block, types, implement blocks, functions) with a **single** blank line.
- Inside a function body, use a blank line between logical groups (setup, work, cleanup), not after every line.
- Between `match` cases, prefer a blank line when cases are multi-line; single-line cases may stay tight.
- Do not use more than one consecutive blank line.
- No blank line immediately after `do` / `if` / `else` / `case` / `for` / `defer` / `unsafe` or immediately before the matching `end`, unless it improves a dense multi-branch block.

```yarrow
Point struct
	i32 x public
	i32 y public
end

Point implement
	distance public function
		reference<Point>
	do
		self const reference<Point>
		self.x self.x * self.y self.y * +
		return
	end with i32
end
```

---

## Comments

- Line comments only: `#` through end of line (see grammar).
- Put a single space after `#`.
- Prefer a comment on its own line above the code it describes.
- Trailing comments are fine for short notes; put one space before `#`.
- Comments are sentences or short phrases. Prefer complete sentences for non-obvious rationale.
- Do not use decorative comment banners in ordinary code. Reserve section banners for long illustrative files (as in the grammar tour).
- Never use an em dash (`—`) in comments.

```yarrow
# Literal u8 coerces to i32 at the declaration site.
42 answer mutable i32

5 10 < if
	"less" io.write_line call   # condition already on the stack
end
```

---

## Naming

| Kind                               | Style             | Examples                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Types (struct, enum, union, error) | `PascalCase`      | `Point`, `Color`, `AppError`, `MyUnion` |
| Functions and methods              | `snake_case`      | `write_line`, `push_last`, `open_file`  |
| Variables and parameters           | `snake_case`      | `my_list`, `score`, `file`              |
| Module aliases                     | `snake_case`      | `io`, `list`, `region`                  |
| Enum / error members               | `SCREAMING_SNAKE` | `RED`, `NOT_FOUND`, `OUT_OF_MEMORY`     |
| File / module path segments        | `snake_case`      | `"helpers.greet"`, `"std.mem"`          |

### Guidelines

- Names are ASCII letters, digits, and underscores (identifiers).
- Prefer full words over cryptic abbreviations (`index` not `idx`, unless the domain standard is short).
- Receiver bindings in methods: use `self` for the `reference<T>` (or `reference<T> mutable`) parameter after it is bound.
- Boolean names read as predicates when practical (`found`, `done`); avoid `is_` / `has_` noise unless it clarifies.
- Fallible helpers name the success path; errors live in the `with |T Err|` type, not in the function name (`lookup` not `try_lookup`).

---

## File layout

Recommended order in a module file:

1. File comment (optional, short)
2. `require` lines (grouped; std first, then local)
3. Type declarations (`struct`, `enum`, `union`, `error`)
4. `Type implement` blocks (immediately after the type they extend when practical)
5. Private helpers
6. Public API functions
7. `main` (entry files only; conventionally last)

```yarrow
# Optional one-line file summary.

"std.io" io require
"std.list" list require
"helpers.greet" greet require

Point struct
	i32 x public
	i32 y public
end

Point implement
	# methods…
end

helper function do
	# …
end

main function do
	# …
end
```

---

## Modules and `require`

- Form: `"path" [alias] require` (keyword last).
- Put requires at the **top of the file** or at the **start of a function** when the import is local to that function.
- Prefer an alias for multi-export modules (`"std.io" io require` → `io.write_line`).
- Omit the alias only for a single-item import or when names enter the current scope without clash (`"std.math.sqrt" require`).
- One `require` per line.
- Sort requires: standard library (`"std.…"`) first, then third-party / local paths, alphabetically within each group if the list grows.

```yarrow
"std.io" io require
"std.list" list require
"std.region" region require

"helpers.greet" greet require
```

---

## Visibility

- Default is **private** for user-declared entities and fields. Omit `private` unless you are documenting intent in an API sketch.
- Mark exports with `public` on the type, field, or function that should leave the module.
- `main` is public by default; do not write `main public function`.
- In `implement` blocks, mark methods `public` only when callers outside the module need them.

```yarrow
Point struct
	i32 x public
	i32 y          # private by default
end

distance public function
	reference<Point>
do
	# …
end with i32
```

---

## Types

### Struct

```yarrow
Name [visibility] struct
	Type field [visibility]
	…
end
```

- One field per line: type, then name, then optional visibility.
- Keep related fields together; no blank lines between fields unless grouping large structs.

### Enum and error

```yarrow
Color enum
	RED
	GREEN
	BLUE
end

AppError error
	NOT_FOUND
	BAD_INPUT
end
```

- One member per line.
- Use explicit discriminants only when the numeric (or carrier) value matters; keep the list readable.

### Union

```yarrow
Value union
	i32
	string
end
```

- One member type per line.
- Prefer a named union for reused shapes; use `|T Err|` for fallible returns.

### Implement

- Place `Name implement … end` next to `Name`’s declaration when both are in the same file.
- Methods follow the same formatting as functions.
- First parameter is usually `reference<T>` or `reference<T> mutable`. Bind it as `self` on the first lines of the body when the method uses the receiver more than once.

---

## Functions

```yarrow
name [visibility] [unsafe] function
	Type [copy | mutable]
	…
do
	# body
end [with Type]
```

### Layout rules

- Put each parameter type on its own line between `function` and `do`.
- No parameter list when there are none: `name function do` … `end`.
- Put `with Type` on the same line as `end` when present: `end with i32`, `end with |i32 AppError|`.
- Omit `with` for `void` returns.
- Nested functions sit inside the enclosing body, indented one level, and appear before the code that calls them when that keeps the story clear.

```yarrow
demo function do
	add function
		i32
		i32 copy
	do
		+
		return
	end with i32

	3 4 add call
	drop
end
```

### Calls

- Push arguments in declaration order (first declared = deepest), then the callee name, then `call`.
- Keep `name call` (or `alias.name call`) on the same line as the last argument when the whole phrase stays short.

```yarrow
3 4 add call
"Hello, Yarrow!" io.write_line call
person borrow
person.greet call unwrap
```

---

## Variables

Form: `<value> <name> (mutable | const | static) <Type>`

```yarrow
42 answer mutable i32
7 limit const i32
3 pi_approx static i32
```

- Prefer `const` when the binding is not reassigned; `mutable` only when `set` (or mutation through a mutable reference) is required; `static` only for compile-time constants.
- Declaration and `name set` stay on one line each.
- Do not rebind with a new declaration to emulate mutation; use `set`.

---

## Stack phrases and operators

- Space-separate words. Never jam tokens together (`1 2 +`, not `1 2+`).
- One primary effect per line. Short pure arithmetic may stay on one line:

```yarrow
1 2 +
self.x self.x * self.y self.y * +
```

- Comparison that feeds control flow sits on the line before the keyword (or on the same line if tiny):

```yarrow
5 10 < if
	# …
end
```

- **Arithmetic** uses `+ - * / // % ^`. **String concatenation** uses `~`. Do not use `+` for strings.
- Prefer named stack ops (`dup`, `swap`, `rot`, `unrot`, `pop`, `drop`) over clever reshuffles when clarity suffers.
- `drop` clears the stack deliberately; do not leave junk values “for later” across unrelated sections.
- After a borrow is finished, `pop` (or consume it in a call) before mutating the owner.

---

## Literals and containers

| Form                | Use                                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `(…)`               | `list` literals                           |
| `[…]`               | `array` literals                          |
| `{ k v … }`         | `hashmap` when keys are literals          |
| `{ field value … }` | struct literals when keys are identifiers |
| `{}` / `()` / `[]`  | empty; only with a typed binding          |

```yarrow
[10 20 30] numbers static array<i32 3>
(43 54 65) my_list static list<i32>
{"first" 4 "second" 5} my_map static hashmap<string i32>
{x 5 y 20} point mutable Point
() empty mutable list<i32>
```

- Put spaces between elements inside containers: `[10 20 30]`, not `[10,20,30]` (no commas in the grammar).
- Use `_` in numeric literals for readability: `1_000`, `0xAB12`.
- Prefer double quotes for strings and single quotes for runes: `"hello"`, `'\n'`.

---

## Control flow

### `if` / `else`

```yarrow
condition if
	# then
else
	# else
end
```

- Condition is a `bool` already on the stack; do not invent a parenthesized test syntax.
- Always use `end`. Include `else` only when needed.
- No else-if chain; use `match` for multi-way branches.

### `match` (value)

```yarrow
subject match
	dup 85 == case
		# …
	end

	dup 50 < case
		# …
	end

	else
		# …
	end
end
```

- Indent cases one level; each `case` … `end` is its own block.
- Keep the subject borrowed for the whole match; restore mental model that the prior stack returns after `end`.

### `match` (union / error)

```yarrow
val match
	i32 case
		# reference<i32> on the stack
	end

	string case
		msg const reference<string>
		# …
	end
end
```

- Use `Type case` for unions; bind the reference when the arm is more than a tiny phrase.

### `for`

```yarrow
counter 5 < for
	# while-style
end

numbers for
	# iterable; use std.loop helpers as needed
end
```

---

## Defer

- Register cleanup early, right after acquiring the resource.
- Prefer a one-line `defer … end` when the body is a single short call; otherwise use a block.

```yarrow
my_region region.create call
defer my_region region.free call end

defer
	file fs.close_file call
end
```

- Remember: multiple defers run in reverse registration order; statements inside one defer still run top to bottom.

---

## Ownership, borrow, move, regions

Style (not the full memory model; see [`MEMORY_MODEL.md`](MEMORY_MODEL.md)):

- Keep borrow spans short and obvious: `borrow`, use, then `pop` or consume.
- After `move`, do not mention the source name again.
- Pair `region.create` with `defer … region.free … end` unless free is intentionally elsewhere.
- Prefer regions for graphs of heap values freed as a unit; prefer `pop` / scope drop for simple locals.

```yarrow
(1 2 3) xs mutable list<i32>
xs borrow
# use reference…
pop
xs 4 list.push_last call unwrap
```

---

## Unsafe

- Mark the function `unsafe function` when its API requires unsafe ops.
- Still wrap the ops in `unsafe … end` at the use site (including inside the unsafe function).
- Callers of unsafe functions must sit inside `unsafe … end`.
- Keep unsafe blocks as small as possible: allocate, touch memory, free.
- Prefer `pointer<T>` typed `load` / `store` over raw `mem.load` / `mem.store` when the pointee type is known.
- Use `mem.allocate` / `mem.free` for the std memory API names.

```yarrow
touch private unsafe function do
	unsafe
		16 mem.allocate p mutable pointer<i32>
		p 42 store
		p load
		drop
		p mem.free
	end
end

main function do
	unsafe
		touch call
	end
end
```

---

## Errors

- Fallible returns use a union: `end with |T Err|` (or `|void Err|`).
- Prefer `unwrap` when the caller’s `with` can propagate the same error type and failure should abort the happy path.
- Prefer `handle` when recovery or a fallback value belongs at the call site.
- Short form when there is no handler body: `call handle <fallback> fallback end`.

```yarrow
5 lookup call unwrap

0 lookup call handle
	match
		AppError.NOT_FOUND case
			"missing" io.write_line call
		end

		else
			"other error" io.write_line call
		end
	end

	-1 fallback
end

0 lookup call handle 0 fallback end
```

---

## Stack hygiene

- Leave the stack as the next reader expects: document lingering values with a short trailing comment when non-obvious (`# Stack: [25]` in tutorials; rare in production code).
- Pop or drop temporaries before starting an unrelated section.
- Do not rely on leftover values across `if` / `match` arms; arms that join must agree on stack shape (language rule) and should agree on intent (style).

---
